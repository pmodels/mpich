			KNOWN ISSUES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Lacking channel-specific features

 * ch3 does not presently support communication across heterogeneous
   platforms (e.g., a big-endian machine communicating with a
   little-endian machine).

 * ch3:nemesis:mx does not support dynamic processes at this time.

 * ch3:nemesis:mx does not typically work with greater than 8 processes
   on a node (initialization failures will occur).  This is an MX
   limitation due to limited SRAM on the Myrinet NICs, not an inherent
   limitation of MPICH2/Nemesis.

 * ch3:ssm and ch3:shm do not support thread safety.

 * ch3:shm does not support dynamic processes (e.g., MPI_Comm_spawn).

 * Support for "external32" data representation is incomplete. This
   affects the MPI_Pack_external and MPI_Unpack_external routines, as
   well the external data representation capabilities of ROMIO.

 * ch3:dllchan is rated "experimental". There are known problems when
   configured with --enable-g and --enable-g=log.


### Build Platforms

 * ch3:nemesis does not work on Solaris. You can use ch3:sock on this
   platform.

 * ch3:ssm uses special interprocess locks (often assembly) that many
   not work with some compilers or machine architectures. It is known
   to work on Linux with GNU, Intel and Pathscale compilers and on
   Windows with the Visual Studio compilers, on Intel and AMD
   architectures.

 * The sctp channel is fully supported for FreeBSD and Mac OS X. As of
   the time of this release, bugs in the stack currently existed in
   the Linux kernel, and will hopefully soon be resolved. It is known
   to not work under Solaris and Windows. For Solaris, the SCTP API
   available in the kernel of standard Solaris 10 is a subset of the
   standard API used by the sctp channel. Cooperation with the Sun
   SCTP developers to support ch3:sctp under Solaris for future
   releases is currently ongoing. For Windows, no known kernel-based
   SCTP stack for Windows currently exists.


### Other configure options

 * --enable-sharedlibs=gcc does not work on Solaris because of
   difference between the GNU ld program and the Solaris ld program.


### Process Managers

 * The MPD process manager can only handle relatively small amounts of
   data on stdin and may also have problems if there is data on stdin
   that is not consumed by the program.

 * The Hydra process manager does not support dynamic processes at
   this time.

 * The SMPD process manager does not work reliably with threaded MPI
   processes. MPI_Comm_spawn() does not currently work for >= 256
   arguments with smpd.


### Performance issues

 * SMP-aware collectives do not perform as well, in select cases, as
   non-SMP-aware collectives, e.g. MPI_Reduce with message sizes
   larger than 64KiB. These can be disabled by the configure option
   "--disable-smpcoll".

 * MPI_Irecv operations that are not explicitly completed before
   MPI_Finalize is called may fail to complete before MPI_Finalize
   returns, and thus never complete. Furthermore, any matching send
   operations may erroneously fail. By explicitly completed, we mean
   that the request associated with the operation is completed by one
   of the MPI_Test or MPI_Wait routines.

 * For passive target RMA, there is no asynchronous agent at the
   target that will cause progress to occur. Progress occurs only when
   the user calls an MPI function at the target (which could well be
   MPI_Win_free).


### C++ Binding:
  
 * The MPI datatypes corresponding to Fortran datatypes are not
   available (e.g., no MPI::DOUBLE_PRECISION).

 * The C++ binding does not implement a separate profiling interface,
   as allowed by the MPI-2 Standard (Section 10.1.10 Profiling).

 * MPI::ERRORS_RETURN may still throw exceptions in the event of an
   error rather than silently returning.
