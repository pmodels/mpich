dnl Process this file with autoconf to produce a configure script.
dnl
dnl aclocal_cache.m4, included by sowing/confdb/aclocal.m4, fixes 
dnl bugs in autoconf caching.
dnl
dnl This is a large configure script and it is important to keep it
dnl clearly organized.  In addition, this script must coordinate with 
dnl the other modules that can be used to construct MPICH2, such as
dnl the communication device and the process manager.  Each of these
dnl may have special features or limitations that other modules or
dnl this configure may need to take into account.  To handle this, there
dnl are xx major steps in this configure script:
dnl
dnl 1. Identify major modules and source any prerequisite scripts
dnl 2. Determine compiler characteristics 
dnl 3. Setup and configure the other modules
dnl 4. Determine MPI features and characteristics (such as datatype values)
dnl
dnl Each of these is described in more detail below.
dnl
dnl 1. Identify the modules (most are specified by 
dnl --with-<modulename>=instance,
dnl for example, --with-pm=mpd or --with-device=ch3:nemesis).
dnl For each module, source the file mpich2prereq if present (in the
dnl module's top-level directory).  This
dnl must be a bourne (sh) shell script; it can access any of the variables
dnl in the configure script.  In addition, there are a few variables that
dnl are defined and provided to allow the modules to communicate their 
dnl needs or limitations to the other modules.  These are:
dnl    MPID_MAX_THREAD_LEVEL - thread level supported by device.
dnl                            if unset, is MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED
dnl    MPID_NO_LONG_LONG     - if yes, the device does not support the 
dnl                            long long integer type
dnl    MPID_NO_LONG_DOUBLE   - if yes, the device does not support the
dnl                            long double type
dnl    MPID_PM_NAMESERVER    - if set, provides the name of the nameserver
dnl                            that the process manager supports.
dnl                            This name server will be used if the
dnl                            default name server is selected.
dnl    MPID_NO_PM            - If yes, the device does not require any
dnl                            PM implementation.  
dnl    MPID_NO_PMI           - If yes, the device does not require any 
dnl                            PMI implementation.
dnl    EXTRA_STATUS_DECL     - Any extra declarations that the device
dnl                            needs added to the definition of MPI_Status.
dnl    MPID_MAX_PROCESSOR_NAME - The maximum number of character in a processor
dnl                            name.  If not set, 128 will be used.
dnl    PMI_REQUIRES_READABLE_TOKENS - if yes, define the C-preprocessor
dnl                            value USE_HUMAN_READABLE_TOKENS, which is
dnl                            used in src/include/mpimem.h to define token
dnl                            separators used in src/util/mem/argstr.c
dnl    PM_REQUIRES_PMI       - if set, provides the name of the PMI 
dnl                            interface implementation.  If not set,
dnl                            the "simple" PMI implementation is used.
dnl                            A process manager that needs a particular
dnl                            process manager should check that this is
dnl                            not set to an incompatible value.
dnl    MPID_NO_SPAWN         - if yes, the device does not support the
dnl                            dynamic process routines (spawn, connect
dnl                            attach, join, plus port and publish 
dnl                            routines).  The major effect of this
dnl                            is to let the test codes know that
dnl                            spawn is not implemented.
dnl    MPID_NO_RMA           - if yes, the device does not support the
dnl                            MPI RMA routines (MPI_Win_create and 
dnl                            MPI_Put etc.).  The major effect of this
dnl                            is to let the test codes know that 
dnl                            RMA is not implemented.
dnl
dnl Note that the meanings of these variables are defined so that an 
dnl undefined value gives the default.  This makes it easy to expand
dnl the set of such variables, since only modules that need the new
dnl variable will need to be changed.
dnl
dnl 2. Determine compiler characteristics
dnl Here is where features of the compilers are determined, including
dnl support for shared libraries and sizes of the basic datatype types.
dnl
dnl 3. Setup and configure the other modules
dnl Before each module configure is executed, the script setup_<module>
dnl is run if present.  This is a bourne (sh) shell script and may
dnl access configure variables.  It should not make any changes to the
dnl compiler name or flags (e.g., do not add -D_XOPEN_SOURCE to CFLAGS here,
dnl because that may invalidate the determination of the compiler 
dnl characteristics in the prior step).
dnl
dnl 4. Determine MPI features
dnl    
dnl
dnl Special environment variables
dnl To let other scripts and in particular the configure in test/mpi
dnl know that they are being invoked from within the MPICH2 configure,
dnl the following environment variables are set and exported:
dnl    FROM_MPICH2
dnl    MPICH2_ENABLE_F77
dnl    MPICH2_ENABLE_F90
dnl    MPICH2_ENABLE_CXX
dnl
dnl The file name here refers to a file in the source being configured
dnl In later versions of autoconf, the binding of AC_INIT changed (!!!)
dnl The original version was AC_INIT(a source file)
dnl The later version is AC_INIT(package,version,[bug-report],[tarname])
dnl Here we use the original version
dnl AC_INIT(src/include/mpiimpl.h)
dnl
dnl Note that no executable statements are allowed (and any are silently 
dnl dropped) before AC_INIT.
dnl
dnl AC_INIT requires an explicit version number
dnl Args are package name, version, bug report, and tar file name
dnl All must be literals
dnl Note that AC_PACKAGE_STRING is not a command but must be defined(!)
dnl Unfortunately, setting the PACKAGE names is not compatible with
dnl AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS, since the resulting values in the generated
dnl conf file will not be consistent.
dnl define([AC_PACKAGE_STRING],[MPICH2 1.0.6])
dnl AC_INIT(mpich2,1.0.6,mpich2-maint@mcs.anl.gov,mpich2-1.0.6)
dnl Use the oldstyle AC_INIT instead
