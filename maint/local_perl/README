This is the "maint/local_perl/" directory for MPICH2.  It contains any
pure-perl modules needed by the MPICH2 maintainer scripts living in
"maint/".  Perl is not and should not be required to build MPICH2, so
these modules should only be used by maintainer scripts.

!!! Please don't put non-pure-perl modules here !!!

Only the lib/ directory will be maintained unarchived in source control.
The distribution tarballs will also be maintained.  All of the extra
stuff that comes with a distribution should not be committed.

Scripts that need to use these modules should insert the following line
near the top of the script (after the shebang line, before modules are
loaded):

-------8<-------
use lib 'maint/local_perl/lib'
-------8<-------
