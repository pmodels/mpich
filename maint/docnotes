This file contains the named document blocks for use in generating the 
documentation.  This is divided into several main blocks:
   Threads and interrups/signals
   Fortran
   Misc MPI (e.g., status null)
   Error classes

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that only one of ThreadSafe and SignalSafe may be used
/*N ThreadSafe
   Thread and Interrupt Safety:

   This routine is thread-safe.  This means that this routine may be
   safely used by multiple threads without the need for any user-provided 
   thread locks.  However, the routine is not interrupt safe.  Typically, 
   this is due to the use of memory allocation routines such as 'malloc'
   or other non-MPICH runtime routines that are themselves not interrupt-safe.
N*/
/*N SignalSafe
   Thread and Interrupt Safety:

   This routine is both thread- and interrupt-safe. 
   This means that this routine may safely be used by multiple threads and
   from within a signal handler.   
N*/
/*N NotThreadSafe
   Thread and Interrupt Safety:

   The user is responsible for ensuring that multiple threads do not try to
   update the same MPI object from different threads.  This routine should 
   not be used from within a signal handler.

   The MPI standard defined a thread-safe interface but this does not 
   mean that all routines may be called without any thread locks.  For
   example, two threads must not attempt to change the contents of the
   same 'MPI_Info' object concurrently.  The user is responsible in this
   case for using some mechanism, such as thread locks, to ensure that 
   only one thread at a time makes use of this routine.  
N*/

Most of the MPI objects are static enough that it isn't necessary to
lock around the routines (even though some ops require updates).  Info isn't
expected to be as robust (there was discussion on the MPI-Forum list
on this). 

/*N ThreadSafeInfoRead

   Thread and Interrupt Safety:

   This routine is thread and interrupt safe only if no MPI routine that 
   updates or frees the same 'MPI_Info' object may be called concurrently 
   with this routine.

   The MPI standard defined a thread-safe interface but this does not 
   mean that all routines may be called without any thread locks.  For
   example, two threads must not attempt to change the contents of the
   same 'MPI_Info' object concurrently.  The user is responsible in this
   case for using some mechanism, such as thread locks, to ensure that 
   only one thread at a time makes use of this routine.  
N*/

/*N ThreadSafeNoUpdate

    Thread and Interrupt Safety:

   This routine is thread and interrupt safe only if no MPI routine that 
   updates or frees the same MPI object may be called concurrently 
   with this routine.

   The MPI standard defined a thread-safe interface but this does not 
   mean that all routines may be called without any thread locks.  For
   example, two threads must not attempt to change the contents of the
   same 'MPI_Info' object concurrently.  The user is responsible in this
   case for using some mechanism, such as thread locks, to ensure that 
   only one thread at a time makes use of this routine.

/*N Fortran
Notes for Fortran:
All MPI routines in Fortran (except for 'MPI_WTIME' and 'MPI_WTICK') have 
an additional argument 'ierr' at the end of the argument list.  'ierr'
is an integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine 
in C.  In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the 
'call' statement.  

All MPI objects (e.g., 'MPI_Datatype', 'MPI_Comm') are of type 'INTEGER'
in Fortran.

/*N FortranStatus
 The 'status' argument must be declared as an array of size 'MPI_STATUS_SIZE',
 as in 'integer status(MPI_STATUS_SIZE)'.
N*/

/*N FortStatusArray
 The 'status' argument must be declared as an array of sise 'MPI_STATUS_SIZE',
 as in 'integer status(MPI_STATUS_SIZE,10)' (assuming no more than 10 
 requests are provided as input).
N*/

/*N FortranString

 The sizes of MPI strings in Fortran are one less than the sizes of that 
 string in C/C++ because the C/C++ versions provide room for the trailing
 null character required by C/C++.  For example, 'MPI_MAX_ERROR_STRING' is 
 'mpif.h' is one smaller than the same value in 'mpi.h'.  See the MPI
 standard, sections 2.6.2 and 4.12.9.

N*/


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*N collops
Notes on collective operations:

The reduction functions ('MPI_Op') do not return an error value.  As a result,
if the functions detect an error, all they can do is either call 'MPI_Abort'
or silently skip the problem.  Thus, if you change the error handler from
'MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL' to something else, for example, 'MPI_ERRORS_RETURN', 
then no error may be indicated.

The reason for this is the performance problems in ensuring that 
all collective routines return the same error value.
N*/

/*N waitstatus
 Notes on the MPI_Status argument:

 The 'MPI_ERROR' field of the status return is only set if 
 the return from the MPI routine is 'MPI_ERR_IN_STATUS'.  That error class
 is only returned by the routines that take an array of status arguments
 ('MPI_Testall', 'MPI_Testsome', 'MPI_Waitall', and 'MPI_Waitsome').  In
 all other cases, the value of the 'MPI_ERROR' field in the status is
 unchanged.  See section 3.2.5 in the MPI-1.1 specification for the 
 exact text.

 For send operations, the only use of status is for 'MPI_Test_cancelled' or
 in the case that there is an error in one of the four routines that 
 may return the error class 'MPI_ERR_IN_STATUS', in which case the 
 'MPI_ERROR' field of status will be set.  In that case, the value 
 will be set to 'MPI_SUCCESS' for any send or receive operation that completed
 successfully, or 'MPI_ERR_PENDING' for any operation which has neither
 failed nor completed.

MPI-2 deprecated some routines (see 2.6.1)
/*N Deprecated
 Deprecated Function:
 The MPI-2 standard deprecated a number of routines because MPI-2 provides
 better versions.  This routine is one of those that was deprecated.  The
 routine may continue to be used, but new code should use the replacement
 routine.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*N Errhandler
    Error handlers:
    The MPI error handler for this routine is taken from 'MPI_COMM_WORLD'.
    For MPI routines that do not have an obvious communicator, file, or
    window object, the MPI standard specifies that the error handler 
    attached to 'MPI_COMM_WORLD' be used.
N*/

This part of the file contains definitions of the MPI error CLASSES for
inclusion in the man pages.  Use .N err name

/*N Errors
Errors:

 All MPI routines (except 'MPI_Wtime' and 'MPI_Wtick') return an error value; 
 C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in the last 
 argument.  Before the value is returned, the current MPI error handler is
 called.  By default, this error handler aborts the MPI job.  The error handler
 may be changed with 'MPI_Comm_set_errhandler' (for communicators), 
 'MPI_File_set_errhandler' (for files), and 'MPI_Win_set_errhandler' (for
 RMA windows).  The MPI-1 routine 'MPI_Errhandler_set' may be used but
 its use is deprecated.  The predefined error handler 
 'MPI_ERRORS_RETURN' may be used to cause error values to be returned.
 Note that MPI does `not` guarentee that an MPI program can continue past
 an error; however, MPI implementations will attempt to continue whenever
 possible.

    implementation is unable to acquire memory.  
N*/
/*N MPI_ERR_IN_STATUS
. MPI_ERR_IN_STATUS - The actual error value is in the 'MPI_Status' argument.
  This error class is returned only from the multiple-completion routines
  ('MPI_Testall', 'MPI_Testany', 'MPI_Testsome', 'MPI_Waitall', 'MPI_Waitany',
  and 'MPI_Waitsome').  The field 'MPI_ERROR' in the status argument
  contains the error value or 'MPI_SUCCESS' (no error and complete) or
  'MPI_ERR_PENDING' to indicate that the request has not completed.
  
  The MPI Standard does not specify what the result of the multiple 
  completion routines is when an error occurs.  For example, in an 
  'MPI_WAITALL', does the routine wait for all requests to either fail or
  complete, or does it return immediately (with the MPI definition of 
  immediately, which means independent of actions of other MPI processes)?
  MPICH has chosen to make the return immediate (alternately, local in MPI 
  terms), and to use the error class 'MPI_ERR_PENDING' (introduced in MPI 1.1)
  to indicate which requests have not completed.  In most cases, only
  one request with an error will be detected in each call to an MPI routine
  that tests multiple requests.  The requests that have not been processed
  (because an error occured in one of the requests) will have their
  'MPI_ERROR' field marked with 'MPI_ERR_PENDING'.
N*/
/*N MPI_ERR_PENDING
. MPI_ERR_PENDING - Pending request (not an error).  See 'MPI_ERR_IN_STATUS'. 
  This value indicates that the request is not complete nor has a encountered
  a detected error.  
N*/
/*N MPI_ERR_REQUEST
. MPI_ERR_REQUEST - Invalid 'MPI_Request'.  Either null or, in the case of a
  'MPI_Start' or 'MPI_Startall', not a persistent request.
N*/
/*N MPI_ERR_BUFFER_ALIAS
.   MPI_ERR_BUFFER - This error class is associcated with an error code that
    indicates that two buffer arguments are `aliased`; that is, the 
    describe overlapping storage (often the exact same storage).  This
    is prohibited in MPI (because it is prohibited by the Fortran 
    standard, and rather than have a separate case for C and Fortran, the
    MPI Forum adopted the more restrictive requirements of Fortran).
