! This file is used to disable certain compiler optimizations that
! can cause incorrect results with the test in greqf.f.  It provides a
! point where extrastate may be modified, limiting the compilers ability
! to move code around.
! The include of mpif.h is not needed in the F77 case but in the
! F90 case it is, because in that case, extrastate is defined as an
! integer (kind=MPI_ADDRESS_KIND), and the script that creates the
! F90 tests from the F77 tests looks for mpif.h
