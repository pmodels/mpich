! This is a very simple test of generalized requests.  Normally, the
! MPI_Grequest_complete function would be called from another routine,
! often running in a separate thread.  This simple code allows us to
! check that requests can be created, tested, and waited on in the
! case where the request is complete before the wait is called.
!
! Note that MPI did *not* define a routine that can be called within
! test or wait to advance the state of a generalized request.
! Most uses of generalized requests will need to use a separate thread.
