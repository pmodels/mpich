# Note that using testmerge at make-time adds a dependency on perl for users.
# It's been like this for a long time, so I don't think it's a problem in
# practice.  The best way to fix this is to drop the nodist_foo_SOURCES lines,
# modify testmerge to output the stamp file, and then enclose modified versions
# of these rules in an "if MAINAINER_MODE".  The files also should then move to
# MAINTAINERCLEANFILES from DISTCLEANFILES. [goodell@ 2011-07-11]
