MPICH2 Test Suite

This test suite is a *supplement* to other test suites, including the
original MPICH testsuite, the Intel testsuite, and the IBM MPI test suite 
(or test suites derived from that test, including the MPI C++ tests).

In many cases, configure will find the MPI implementation
automatically.  In some cases, it will need some help.  For example:

For IBM MPI, where the compilation commands are not mpicc and mpif77 etc.:

./configure CC=xlc MPICC=mpcc F77=xlf MPIF77=mpxlf CXX=xlC \
                       MPICXX="mpCC -cpp" F90=xlf90 MPIF90=mpxlf90 \
		       --disable-spawn \
		       --enable-strictmpi

(or the _r versions of the compilers)

If mpicc and friends are not in your default path (and you do not want to
add them), you can specify the path with --with-mpi=<path>.  For example,
if they are in /usr/local/mympi/bin, use

./configure --with-mpi=/usr/local/mympi 

(configure will append the bin to the path that you give).

You may need to add MPI_SIZEOF_OFFSET=8 .

The option "-cpp" is needed for at least some versions of mpCC to define the
C++ bindings of the MPI routines.

For implementations that do not implement all of MPI-2, there are --disable
options, including --disable-spawn and --disable-cxx.  To restrict tests to 
just what is defined in the MPI specification, use --enable-strictmpi .

The script that runs the tests assumes that the MPI implementation
supports mpiexec; you should consider this the first test of the implementation.

For systems that run applications through a batch system, the option "-batch"
to the runtests script will create a script file that can be edited and 
submitted to the batch system.  The script checktests can be run to 
summarize the results.  

Specifically, (assuming the bash shell, and that the directory "btest", a
subdirectory of the test suite directory, is used for running the tests):

export MPITEST_BATCH_DIR=`pwd`/btest
runtests -batch -tests=testlist
... edit btest/runtests.batch to make it a value batch submissions script
... run that script and wait for the batch job to complete
cd btest && ../checktests 

Note that some programs that are used to run MPI programs add extra output, 
which can confuse any tool that depends on clean output in STDOUT.  Since
such unfortunate behavior is common, the option -ignorebogus can be given 
to checktests:

cd btest && ../checktests --ignorebogus
