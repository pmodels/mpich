In many cases, configure will find the MPI implementation
automatically.  In some cases, it will need some help.  For example:

For IBM MPI, where the compilation commands are not mpicc and mpif77 etc.:

./configure --with-mpi CC=xlc MPICC=mpcc F77=xlf MPIF77=mpxlf CXX=xlC
                       MPICXX=mpCC F90=xlf90 MPIF90=mpxlf90

You may need to add MPI_SIZEOF_OFFSET=8 .

The script that runs the tests assumes that the MPI implementation
supports mpiexec; you should consider this the first test of the implementation.
