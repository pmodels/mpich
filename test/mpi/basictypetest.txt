# This file is used by autogen.sh to generate multiple binary files for datatype testing.
# Every line must have the format:
#
# <test pathname>:<ssv macros>:<ssv counts>:timeLimit=<seconds>:<procs#>
#
# The autogen.sh script generates a single binary for every line. Each binary will appear in
# the testlist file multiple times, corresponding to different combinations of basic datatypes
# (a list of which is defined in basictypelist.txt) and counts. Each binary will be built
# using the additional user defined macros (e.g., BCAST_COMM_WORLD_ONLY).
# Naming of produced binaries will be in the form: <basename__BASIC__Lk> where 'k' is the line
# number in this file (this is only used to differentiate between binaries generated with
# different user defined macros while keeping the filename length reasonable).
# The BASIC component in the name states this is a basic test, as opposite to the STRUCT tests.
# BASIC is also used in the runtest.in script to limit the number of basic types to test for
# the basic tests (there is no need to limit these for STRUCT tests).
#
# NOTE: the first, third, and fifth fields are mandatory (i.e., there must be a valid file pathname,
# count, and number of processes to run the test).
