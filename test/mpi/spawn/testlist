# The concurrent_spawns test can overtax the process manager, so
# we set a shorter time limit in case it hangs.
# There's a problem with mpd that causes concurrent_spawns to cause problems
# with mpd, leading to many runaway concurrent_spawn processes.  This 
# test is being disabled until mpd is fixed.
