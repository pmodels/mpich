C This is a very simple test of generalized requests.  Normally, the
C MPI_Grequest_complete function would be called from another routine,
C often running in a separate thread.  This simple code allows us to
C check that requests can be created, tested, and waited on in the
C case where the request is complete before the wait is called.  
C
C Note that MPI did *not* define a routine that can be called within
C test or wait to advance the state of a generalized request.  
C Most uses of generalized requests will need to use a separate thread.
