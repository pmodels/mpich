/*
 * This file contains the C routines used in testing the c2f and f2c
 * handle conversion functions for MPI_File
 * The tests follow this pattern:
 *
 *  Fortran main program
 *     calls c routine with each handle type, with a prepared
 *     and valid handle (often requires constructing an object)
 *
 *     C routine uses xxx_f2c routine to get C handle, checks some
 *     properties (i.e., size and rank of communicator, contents of datatype)
 *
 *     Then the Fortran main program calls a C routine that provides
 *     a handle, and the Fortran program performs similar checks.
 *
 * We also assume that a C int is a Fortran integer.  If this is not the
 * case, these tests must be modified.
