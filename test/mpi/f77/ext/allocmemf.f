C This program makes use of a common (but not universal; g77 doesn't 
C have it) extension: the "Cray" pointer.  This allows MPI_Alloc_mem
C to allocate memory and return it to Fortran, where it can be used.
C As this is not standard Fortran, this test is not run by default.
C To run it, build (with a suitable compiler) and run with
C   mpiexec -n 1 ./allocmemf
