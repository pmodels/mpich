Tests to create or code to modify
This list is based on the results of the coverage analysis.  Because of errors 
in the GNU coverage code (it appears to lose data if two processes 
simulateously update the same coverage data file), there may be some 
items listed here that are already sufficiently tested.

(completed tests moved below)

6. Collective code:
   a) mark off heterogeneous code so that it is not compiled for
      homogeneous devices -- partially done
   b) make sure that all algorithms are covered: short and long 
      messages; differing numbers of processes, including non powers
      of two.  May only need to further divide the Intel tests to 
      include collective tests for varying numbers of processes.

        opband types: logical (f77), unsigned, long, long_long, 
		unsigned long, short, unsigned short, char, unsigned char,
		byte
	opbor types: int, unsigned, long, long long, unsigned long, short,
		unsigned short, char, unsigned char, byte
	opbxor types: int, unsigned, long, long long, unsigned long, short, 
		unsigned short, char, unsigned char, byte
	opland types: logical (f77), integer (f77)

	red_scat: differnt alg lengths

	reduce: run with non powers of two, both odd and even values
		run with root in various places, particularly with non
		power of two nodes.
	
   d) Intercommunicator collective tests are needed.  These could be
      implemented by using the non-collective definition code; e.g.,
      the "trivial" implementation in terms of MPI_Send and MPI_Recv.
      The tests should use intercomms with both the same and different
      sized groups.
	  Reduce_scatter
	  Alltoallw
   e) Tests for MPI_IN_PLACE are needed
   f) Tests for sendcounts of 0 are needed, particularly in the xxxv functions
      and in the allxxx functions (e.g., alltoallv for ghostpoint exchange)

7. Set and get name for comm, predefined name MPI_COMM_PARENT.  
   Also, test *ALL* datatype names.
9. Check the use of error macros in intercomm create and merge; also
   consider adding tests that would exercise this code.
10. Datatype info routines: get address (use address test), get count
    (for partial datatype; use example from MPI book), get elements 
    (for partial datatype, done with pack and datatype)
11. pack (see lines 184-208 in pack.c)
12. status_set_elements - combine with get_elements to ensure that the 
    correct values are set.
13. create_hindexed, create_hvector, and create-struct.  These can use
    the MPI-1 tests, with the data-types suitably updated.  Add these
    to the Intel tests. - done for C.  Need to do Fortran (needs
    Fortran address_kind type)
15. type_extent - check lines 99/100 (in coverage file)
16. type util - make sure that setup of builtins is performed.
16a. Type free, get-extent, true_extent for derived types.  Make sure all
    allocated space is freed
17a Add tests for comm call errhandler
18. comm set,get errhandler - use MPI-1 versions.  Also apply to win, file.
    Also user-defined errhandlers.  Make sure references work correctly (e.g.,
    if freed while still in communicator, or freed after communicator is 
    freed).
19. errutil.c - make sure MPIR_Err_preinit protected in error macros.
	Test by compiling with error checking off, then check symbol
	table of library
20. (win set/get/call errhandler) - see 18
22. Ensure group diff error checks are error macro protected
24. group intersection error check ; group union error check
26. ensure that attributes on comm self are freed in
    the correct order by MPI_Finalize (see MPI-2 spec; comm_self is 
    freed FIRST, then the order is undefined).  In particular, MPI_Finalized
    returns false in the comm_self attribute delete functions.
27. Add tests for finalized, initthread, ismain, querythread, version
    -- all but finalized and ismain from another thread
29. Add tests for generalized requests, including cancelling a generalized
    request.
30. Add tests for Request_free for regular send or receive requests.
34. Topology tests:
    graph-create - n == 0
    topoutil - see line 92+; add test (dup communicator with topology)
35. Ixsend to self.
      If thread multiple, all MPI_Issend, MPI_Ssend to self, with no posted
      receive when send initiated.
38. Add tests for all RMA (get, put, accumulate, 
    win_complete, win_test, win_lock, win_unlock, win_post, win_start,
    win_wait)
39. Add tests for dynamic processes
    open_port, close_port, accept, connect, spawn, spawn multiple
40. Add tests for all of MPI-IO not already covered.
    (These may now be covered by the John May test)
    These include the routines in the files (entire file if no notes on that
    file):
    open.c (a few lines, including if(!rank)ADIO_Set_shared_fp
       filenames with filesystem, e.g., nfs:name
       Open in APPEND mode
    delete.c
       filenames with filesystem
    get_view.c (roughly lines 99ff, at Type_contiguous)
    set_view.c (for MPI_DISPLACEMENT_CURRENT)
    set_info.c
    seek_sh.c (for MPI_SEEK_CUR)
    read_sh/write_sh
        atomicity && file system NOT NFS
41. Delete/free attributes on datatypes, windows; Fortran versions (to 
    get int instead of pointer-to-int)
42. Keyval free (F90 and C++)
43. Type create indexed block
44. Type create resized

Also, 
Replace the calls to MPIR_Group_release in Finalize with
MPIR_Process.group_release, and set the pointer to this routine when
the group code is used.

--- DONE ---
1. Free keyvals, while in use in a communicator and while not in use
2. User copy and delete functions on keyvals
   a) Also check error return on attribute copy during comm dup.  This
      should be a recoverable error.
3. Check all 7 predefined attributes on comm world
4. Set multiple attributes, in various orders (to ensure that all
   branches of the insert-into-list of keyvals code are exercised).
5. Perform attribute tests with comm, type, win (same code?)
6. Collective tests:
   b. Misc
	opland types: long long, char, unsigned char, float, double, 
		long double
	oplor types: long long, char, unsigned char, float, double, 
		long double
	bcast: non contig input type (e.g., broadcast a vector).
        bcast: long messages
	alltoall: long messages are not covered
   c) Need tests for Alltoallw, Exscan.
   d. Intercomm collective
        bcast
	reduce
	allreduce
	allgather
        Gatherv
	Scatterv
	Allgatherv
	Alltoall
	Alltoallv
	Barrier
7. Set and get name for comm, type, win.  Check predefined names.
	
8. dup an intercommunicator (context generation in commutil); 
	also check the handling of attributes after the dup.
   - dup done, still need to check attribute handling - done 
8a) Get group of an intercommunicator
14. type_dup.  Apply to both predefined and user defined types.
    (Should be done; see fkeyvaltype)
17. Add tests for add-error-class, code, string; -- done
21. Ensure group compare unequal (line 142--145 in source) are tested;
    this is for groups of the same size but with different processes -- done
23. group incl with empty group as output (n == 0)
25. groupdebug.c - use debug macro marker for debug routine (and do
    not compile unless enable-g=something is set).
28. bsendutil.c - construct tests to ensure that all branches are
    tested.  For example, arrange for different completion orders for
    entries added to the buffer (e.g., use send but then do the
    receives in a particular order, and make the data large enough to
    trigger rendezvous sending in the internal Isend).  - test added (need
    to test against the coverage tests)
31. request_get_status; can be tested as if MPI_Test, but does not free
    the request (really a nondestructive MPI_Test) (also see 29.)
32. For testall, testsome, waitall, and waitsome.  Add tests that
    trigger the MPI_ERR_IN_STATUS, by using MPI_ERR_TRUNCATE for
    receives. -- done for all four.
33. Add tests for lookup/publish/unpublish.  use host:port values as
    port name. -- done
34. Topology tests:
    cart-map - newrank undefined - done
    cart-shift - displ == 0 - done
    cart-sub - remove all dimensions - done
    dims-create - see code FIXME (-done-maybe)
    graph_map - newrank undefined - done
    topotest - undefined - done
36. Add tests for info delete, dup, getvaluelen.  Add enough tests to 
    check insert at beginning, middle, end. -- all done
37. Add tests for info set that replaces an existing value. -- done
38. Add tests for all RMA (alloc mem, free mem, (get, put, accumulate)-
    with win_fence, 
    win_create, win_free, win_get_group, 
    win_get_name, win_set_name, 
40. Add tests for all of MPI-IO not already covered.
