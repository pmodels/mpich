Notes:
While not a post routine, this routine can generate events.  In fact,
unlike the post routine, many MPIDI_CH3I_SOCK_OP_ACCEPT events can
be generated from a listener (typically one per incoming connection attempt).

The implementation may generate an event as soon it is notified that a

It is also possible that the connection may fail to 
complete, causing MPIDI_CH3I_Sock_accept() to be unable to obtain a sock
despite the event notification. 

The environment variable MPICH_PORT_RANGE=min:max may be used to
restrict the ports mpich processes listen on. 

Thread safety:
The addition of the listener sock object to the sock set may occur
while other threads are performing operations on the same sock 
set.  Thread safety of simultaneously operations on the same sock set
must be guaranteed by the Sock implementation.

Thread safety:

in forming a connection.  Having a complete set of interface information also allows a particular interface be used selected by the
