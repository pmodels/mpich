      * Add integer compare-and-swap fairness test.
      * Add pointer version of compare-and-swap fairness test.
      * Added configure test for pthread_yield.

goodell (6):
      * Fix bad include guard in the opa_by_lock.h header.
      * Add new "unsafe" primitives.  Also minor updates to the docs.
      * Add support for 64-bit PPC.
      * Update README to reflect 64-bit PPC support.

      * Actually include the COPYRIGHT and CHANGELOG files in the distribution.

jayesh (1):
      * Fixed compiler warnings in NT intrinsics. Now type casting the arguments to NT intrinsics correctly


=============
OpenPA v1.0.1
=============

Major Changes:
      * Fix for x86/x86_64 machines that don't support SSE2 and therefore lfence/mfence.
      * Fix major bug in SC on PPC.  Fixes ticket #8.

Individual Change Summary By Developer:

buntinas (2):
      * Work around PGI compiler bug by rearranging input parameters
      * check for pre-Pentium 4 machines which don't support mfence and lfence

fortnern (2):
      * Add/improve tests for fetch_and_{incr,decr}_int and fetch_and_add_int.
      * Add some tests for OPA_cas_int.  Also fix a bug in the fetch and * tests.

goodell (6):
      * Remove erroneous "C" mode from some emacs modelines.
      * Fix Darius' email address in the COPYRIGHT file.
      * Update the README version number to match configure.in.
      * Add an "all-executable" target to support parallel make in MPICH2.
      * Fix major bug in SC on PPC.  Fixes ticket #8.
      * Add new header files to the appropriate automake variables.
