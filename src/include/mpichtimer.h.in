/*@
  MPID_Wtime - Return a time stamp
  
  Output Parameter:
. timeval - A pointer to an 'MPID_Wtime_t' variable.

  Notes:
  This routine returns an `opaque` time value.  This difference between two
  time values returned by 'MPID_Wtime' can be converted into an elapsed time
  in seconds with the routine 'MPID_Wtime_diff'.

  This routine is defined this way to simplify its implementation as a macro.
  For example, the for Intel x86 and gcc, 
.vb
#define MPID_Wtime(timeval) \
     __asm__ __volatile__("rdtsc" : "=A" (*timeval))
.ve

  For some purposes, it is important
  that the timer calls change the timing of the code as little as possible.
  This form of a timer routine provides for a very fast timer that has
  minimal impact on the rest of the code.  

  From a semantic standpoint, this format emphasizes that any particular
  timer value has no meaning; only the difference between two values is 
  meaningful.

  Module:
  Timer

  Question:
  MPI-2 allows 'MPI_Wtime' to be a macro.  We should make that easy; this
  version does not accomplish that.
  @*/
void MPID_Wtime( MPID_Time_t * timeval);

/*@
  MPID_Wtime_diff - Compute the difference between two time stamps

  Input Parameters:
. t1, t2 - Two time values set by 'MPID_Wtime' on this process.
 

  Output Parameter:
. diff - The different in time between t2 and t1, measured in seconds.

  Note: 
  If 't1' is null, then 't2' is assumed to be differences accumulated with
  'MPID_Wtime_acc', and the output value gives the number of seconds that
  were accumulated.

  Question:
  Instead of handling a null value of 't1', should we have a separate
  routine 'MPID_Wtime_todouble' that converts a single timestamp to a 
  double value?  

  Module:
  Timer
  @*/
void MPID_Wtime_diff( MPID_Time_t *t1, MPID_Time_t *t2, double *diff );

/*@
  MPID_Wtime_acc - Accumulate time values

  Input Parameters:
. t1,t2,t3 - Three time values.  't3' is updated with the difference between 
             't2' and 't1': '*t3 += (t2 - t1)'.

  Notes:
  This routine is used to accumulate the time spent with a block of code 
  without first converting the time stamps into a particular arithmetic
  type such as a 'double'.  For example, if the 'MPID_Wtime' routine accesses
  a cycle counter, this routine (or macro) can perform the accumulation using
  integer arithmetic.  

  To convert a time value accumulated with this routine, use 'MPID_Wtime_diff' 
  with a 't1' of zero.

  Timer

  MPID_Wtime_todouble - Converts an MPID timestamp to a double 

  Input Parameter:
. timeval - 'MPID_Time_t' time stamp

  Output Parameter:
. seconds - Time in seconds from an arbitrary (but fixed) time in the past

  Notes:
  This routine may be used to change a timestamp into a number of seconds,
  suitable for 'MPI_Wtime'.  

  @*/
void MPID_Wtime_todouble( MPID_Time_t *timeval, double *seconds );

/*@
  MPID_Wtick - Provide the resolution of the 'MPID_Wtime' timer

  Return value:
  Resolution of the timer in seconds.  In many cases, this is the 
  time between ticks of the clock that 'MPID_Wtime' returns.  In other
  words, the minimum significant difference that can be computed by 
  'MPID_Wtime_diff'.

  Note that in some cases, the resolution may be estimated.  No application
  should expect either the same estimate in different runs or the same
  value on different processes.

  Module:
  Timer
  @*/
double MPID_Wtick( void );

/*@
  MPID_Wtime_init - Initialize the timer

  Note:
  This routine should perform any steps needed to initialize the timer.
  In addition, it should set the value of the attribute 'MPI_WTIME_IS_GLOBAL'
  if the timer is known to be the same for all processes in 'MPI_COMM_WORLD'
  (the value is zero by default).

  If any operations need to be performed when the MPI program calls 
  'MPI_Finalize' this routine should register a handler with 'MPI_Finalize'
  (see the MPICH Design Document).
  
  Return Values:
  0 on success.  -1 on Failure.  1 means that the timer may not be used
  until after MPID_Init completes.  This allows the device to set up the
  timer (first needed for Blue Gene support).

  Module:
  Timer

  @*/
int MPID_Wtime_init(void);

/* Inlined timers.  Note that any definition of one of the functions
   prototyped above in terms of a macro will simply cause the compiler
   to use the macro instead of the function definition.

   Currently, all except the Windows performance counter timers
   define MPID_Wtime_init as null; by default, the value of
   MPI_WTIME_IS_GLOBAL is false.
