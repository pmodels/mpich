/*
 * Description of the Bsend data structures.
 *
 * Bsend is buffered send; a buffer, provided by the user, is used to store
 * both the user's message and information that my be needed to send that
 * message.  In addition, space within that buffer must be allocated, so
 * additional information is required to manage that space allocation.
 * In the following, the term "segment" denotes a fragment of the user buffer
 * that has been allocated either to free (unused) space or to a particular
 * user message.
 *
 * The following datastructures are used:
 *
 *  BsendMsg_t  - Describes a user message, including the values of tag
 *                and datatype (*could* be used in case the data is already
 *                contiguous; see below)
 *  BsendData_t - Describes a segment of the user buffer.  This data structure
 *                contains a BsendMsg_t for segments that contain a user
 *                message.  Each BsendData_t segment belongs to one of
 *                three lists: avail (unused and free), active (currently
 *                sending) and pending (contains a user message that has
 *                not begun sending because of some resource limit, such
 *                as no more MPID requests available).
 *  BsendBuffer - This global structure contains pointers to the user buffer
 *                and the three lists, along with the size of the user buffer.
