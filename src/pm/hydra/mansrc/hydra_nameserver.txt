hydra_nameserver - program to support MPI's name publishing features with hydra

Description:
    Hydra is the default name service for MPI\'s name publishing features
    (MPI_PUBLISH_NAME/MPI_LOOKUP_NAME). For programs launched by separate
    hydra instances, a separate nameserver mechanism need be launched in
    order for the name publishing to work across multiple process managers.

    This can be achieved with hydra_nameserver. For example\:
.vb
    shell@myhost1$ hydra_nameserver &
    shell@myhost1$ mpiexec -hosts myhost1,myhost2 -n 4 -nameserver myhost1 ./a.out
.ve
