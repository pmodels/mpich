## a note about DIST_SUBDIRS:
## We conditionally add DIST_SUBDIRS entries because we conditionally configure
## these subdirectories.  See the automake manual's "Unconfigured
## Subdirectories" section, which lists this rule: "Any directory listed in
## DIST_SUBDIRS and SUBDIRS must be configured."
##
## The implication for "make dist" and friends is that we should only "make
## dist" in a tree that has been configured to enable to directories that we
## want to distribute.  Because of this, we will probably need to continue using 
## the release.pl script because various SUBDIRS are incompatible with each
## other.
