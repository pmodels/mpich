This file contains man page information on special routines (such as
MPI_SIZEOF) that exist only in F90, and on the F90 extended support)

/*N FortranExtended

 Extended Fortran Support:
 
 This routine is part of the extended Fortran support, described in
 Sections 10.2.4 and 10.2.5 in the MPI-2 Standard.  Full support for these
 features `cannot` be efficiently implemented within the Fortran 90 
 language and would require a nonportable interation with specific 
 Fortran 90 compilers.  MPICH2 has chosen to offer many of the features
 of the extended Fortran support, but there are limitations.  
 For example, some routines may accept only scalars or one-dimensional 
 arrays.

/*D
   MPI_SIZEOF - Return the size of a data item

   Synopsis:
   subroutine mpi_sizeof( var, size, ierr )
   <type> var
   integer size, ierr

   Notes:
   This routine returns the size of a basic element, in bytes, of the
   item passed in the first argument.  

   Implementation limitations:
   MPICH only supports scalars and one-dimensional arrays for the 
   first parameter.  Supporting higher-dimensional arrays greatly increases
   the size of the library and the executable without adding any new 
   functionality.  If you have a multi-dimensional array, simply pass any
   element to 'MPI_SIZEOF'.
