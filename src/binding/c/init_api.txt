    'MPI_Finalize'.

    thread that initialized MPI with either 'MPI_Init' or 'MPI_Init_thread'.

/*
    Notes:
       The MPI standard does not say what a program can do before an 'MPI_INIT' or
       after an 'MPI_FINALIZE'.  In the MPICH implementation, you should do
       as little as possible.  In particular, avoid anything that changes the
       external state of the program, such as opening files, reading standard
       input or writing to standard output.

    Thread and Signal Safety:
        This routine must be called by one thread only.  That thread is called
        the `main thread` and must be the thread that calls 'MPI_Finalize'.

    Notes for C:
        As of MPI-2, 'MPI_Init' will accept NULL as input parameters. Doing so
        will impact the values stored in 'MPI_INFO_ENV'.

    Notes for Fortran:
    The Fortran binding for 'MPI_Init' has only the error return
    .vb
        subroutine MPI_INIT(ierr)

    made concurrently from two distinct threads (all MPI calls are serialized).
    - MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE - Multiple threads may call MPI, with no restrictions.
