    'MPI_Finalize'.

    The MPI standard requires that 'MPI_Finalize' be called `only` by the same
    thread that initialized MPI with either 'MPI_Init' or 'MPI_Init_thread'.

/*
    Notes:
       The MPI standard does not say what a program can do before an 'MPI_INIT' or
       after an 'MPI_FINALIZE'.  In the MPICH implementation, you should do
       as little as possible.  In particular, avoid anything that changes the
       external state of the program, such as opening files, reading standard
       input or writing to standard output.

    Thread and Signal Safety:
        This routine must be called by one thread only.  That thread is called
        the `main thread` and must be the thread that calls 'MPI_Finalize'.

    Notes for C:
        As of MPI-2, 'MPI_Init' will accept NULL as input parameters. Doing so
        will impact the values stored in 'MPI_INFO_ENV'.

    Notes for Fortran:
    The Fortran binding for 'MPI_Init' has only the error return
    .vb
        subroutine MPI_INIT(ierr)
        integer ierr

    Command line arguments:

    thread will make MPI calls (all MPI calls are funneled to the
    main thread).
    . MPI_THREAD_SERIALIZED - The process may be multi-threaded, and multiple
    threads may make MPI calls, but only one at a time: MPI calls are not
    made concurrently from two distinct threads (all MPI calls are serialized).
    - MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE - Multiple threads may call MPI, with no restrictions.

    If 'MPI_Init' was called instead of 'MPI_Init_thread', the level of
    thread support is defined by the implementation.  This routine allows
    you to find out the provided level.  It is also useful for library
    routines that discover that MPI has already been initialized and
    wish to determine what level of thread support is available.
