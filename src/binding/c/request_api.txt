/*
    Notes:
    The primary expected use of 'MPI_Cancel' is in multi-buffering
    schemes, where speculative 'MPI_Irecvs' are made.  When the computation
    completes, some of these receive requests may remain; using 'MPI_Cancel' allows
    the user to cancel these unsatisfied requests.

    Cancelling a send operation is much more difficult, in large part because the
    send will usually be at least partially complete (the information on the tag,
    size, and source are usually sent immediately to the destination).
    Users are
    advised that cancelling a send, while a local operation (as defined by the MPI
    standard), is likely to be expensive (usually generating one or more internal
    messages).

    This routine is normally used to free inactive persistent requests created with

    longer be used in a wait or test routine (e.g., 'MPI_Wait') to determine
    completion.

    This routine may also be used to free a non-persistent requests such as those
    created with 'MPI_Irecv' or 'MPI_Isend' and friends.  Like active persistent
    requests, once freed, the request can no longer be used with test/wait routines

    calls and, in a high qualilty implementation, indicates all of the requests
    that have completed when 'MPI_Waitsome' is called.

    request has completed; there is no guarantee that `all` completed requests
    will be returned, or that the entries in 'array_of_indices' will be in
    increasing order. Also, requests that are completed while 'MPI_Waitsome' is
    executing may or may not be returned, depending on the timing of the
    completion of the message.
