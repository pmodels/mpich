The MPE-2 has a top level configure.in and all the C source files are
splitted into 4 subpackages, each has its own include and source directory
and configure.  Because of this structure, the install and build include
directory contains only relevant user .h files, i.e. mpe.h,
mpe_log.h, mpe_logf.h, mpe_graphics.h, mpe_graphicsf.h and mpe_misc.h.
(no more basex11.h, basex11.h...).  Some of the include files could be 
empty if the corresponding subpackage is not built.

mpe2/include : contains mpe.h, mpe_log.h, mpe_graphics.h and mpe_misc.h.
               Note: mpe_log.h, mpe_graphics.h and mpe_misc.h in mpe2/include
               are empty.  They will be updated with the real ones if
               the corresponding packages are configured successfully.

- The top level configure checks for F77 characteristics and stores them
  in mpe2/mpe_conf.h and checks for the usability of MPI_CC and MPI_F77.
  The 4 subpackages are src/misc, src/logging, src/wrappers and src/graphics.
  Each subpackage checks for the features that it needs.

  1) mpe2/src/misc: contains dbxerr.c.in and definition of MPE_Errors_xx,
                    MPE_Seq_xxx(), MPE_xxxTags() and MPE_GetHostName().
     mpe2/src/misc/include: contains mpe_misc.h.
                            The header file will be pushed to mpe2/include
                            if mpe2/src/misc is configured successfully.

  2) mpe2/src/logging: contains CLOG-2 and MPE_Log_xxx() routines.
     mpe2/src/logging/include: contains mpe_log.h, mpe_logf.h.
                               The header files will be pushed to mpe2/include
                               if mpe2/src/logging is configured successfully.
 
  3) mpe2/src/wrappers: contains various MPI wrapper libraries,
                        MPI logging library, liblmpe.a,
                        MPI tracing library, libtmpe.a,
                        MPI Fortran to C library, libmpe_f2cmpi.a.

  4) mpe2/src/graphics: contains MPE X graphics routines and MPI animation
                        library, libampe.a.  This subpackage is all X related.
     mpe2/src/graphics/include: contains mpe_graphics.h, mpe_graphicsf.h
                                The header files will be pushed to mpe2/include
                                if mpe2/src/graphics is configured successfully.

  only package mpe2/src/wrappers requires package mpe2/src/logging,
  the others are pretty much independent from one another.

  5) src/unused: contains MPE routines that has no user headers and have 
                 never compiled into any MPE library since last MPE 
                 reorganization done with release of mpich-1.2.1.
                 Like MPE_Counter_xxx() functions and other MPE_Log_xxx()
                 macros and functions that are not needed in src/logging.   
                 None of the files in this directory is compiled into
                 any MPE library.
