Pipelining in ROMIO adio lustre driver

Sunwoo Lee <sunwoolee1.2014@u.northwestern.edu>

This version of MPICH overlaps the first and second phases of
two-phase collective I/O. The pipelining is enabled by the
following configure option:

  --enable-pipelining-io

The --enable-pipelining-io configure option enables the pipelining
and the two-phase I/O will be performed in a pipelined fashion.
For a two-phase collective write request, each aggregator aggregates
a single stripe at a time and performs write. While the write time,
the next stripe is aggregated so that the communication time is
overlapped with the I/O time.
