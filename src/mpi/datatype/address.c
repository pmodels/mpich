    MPI_Address - Gets the address of a location in memory

Input Parameters:
. location - location in caller memory (choice)

Output Parameters:
. address - address of location (address integer)

    Note:
    This routine is provided for both the Fortran and C programmers.
    On many systems, the address returned by this routine will be the same
    as produced by the C '&' operator, but this is not required in C and
    may not be true of systems with word- rather than byte-oriented
    instructions or systems with segmented address spaces.

.N Deprecated
The replacement for this routine is 'MPI_Get_address'.
