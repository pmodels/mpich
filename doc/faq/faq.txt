%% Section: General Information
%% Heading: Q: What is MPICH2?
%% Filename: intro
%% End
MPICH2 is a freely available, portable implementation of
\href{http://www.mpi-forum.org}{MPI}, the Standard for 
message-passing libraries.  It implements both MPI-1 and MPI-2.

%% Heading: Q: What does MPICH stand for?
%% Filename: mpichname
%% End
A: MPI stands for Message Passing Interface.
The CH comes from Chameleon, the portability layer used in the original 
MPICH to provide portability to the existing message-passing systems.

%% Heading: Q: Can MPI be used to program multicore systems?
%% Filename: multicore
%% End
A: There are two common ways to use MPI with multicore processors or
multiprocessor nodes:

Use one MPI process per core (here, a core is defined as a program
counter and some set of arithmetic, logic, and load/store units). 

Use one MPI process per node (here, a node is defined as a collection
of cores that share a single address space).  Use threads or
compiler-provided parallelism to exploit the multiple cores.  OpenMP
may be used with MPI; the loop-level parallelism of OpenMP may be used
with any implementation of MPI (you do not need an MPI that supports
\texttt{MPI\_THREAD\_MULTIPLE} when threads are used only for computational
tasks). This is sometimes called the hybrid programming model.

%% Section: Building MPICH2
%% Heading: Q: What is the difference between the MPD and SMPD process managers?
%% Filename: mpd-smpd
%% End
MPD is the default process manager for MPICH2 on Unix platforms. It is written in
Python. SMPD is the primary process manager for MPICH2 on Windows. It
is also used for running on a combination of Windows and Linux
machines. It is written in C.

%% Heading: Q: Do I have to configure/make/install MPICH2 each time for each \
 compiler I use?
%% Filename: compilers
%% End
No, in many cases you can build MPICH2 using one set of compilers and then
use the libraries (and compilation scripts) with other compilers.  However, 
this depends on the compilers producing \emph{compatible} object files.
Specifically, the compilers must
\begin{itemize}
\item Support the same basic datatypes with the same sizes.  For example, the
 C compilers should use the same sizes for \texttt{long long} and 
 \texttt{long double}. 
\item Map the names of routines in the source code to names in the object
 files in the object file in the same way.  This can be a problem for Fortran
 and C++ compilers, though you can often force the Fortran compilers to use
 the same name mapping.  More specifically, most Fortran compilers map names
 in the source code into all lower-case with one or two underscores appended
 to the name.  To use the same MPICH2 library with all Fortran compilers,
 those compilers must make the same name mapping.  There is one exception to
 this that is described below.
\item Perform the same layout for C structures.  The C langauge does not
 specify how structures are layed out in memory.  For 100\% compatibility, all
 compilers must follow the same rules.  However, if you do not use any of the 
 \texttt{MPI\_MIN\_LOC} or \texttt{MPI\_MAX\_LOC} datatypes, and you do not
 rely on the MPICH2 library to set the extent of a type created with 
 \texttt{MPI\_Type\_struct} or \texttt{MPI\_Type\_create\_struct}, you can
 often ignore this requirement.
\item Require the same additional runtime libraries.  Not all compilers will
 implement the same version of Unix, and some routines that MPICH2 uses may be
 present in only some of the run time libraries associated with specific
 compilers.  
\end{itemize}
The above may seem like a stringent set of requirements, but in practice, many
 systems and compiler sets meet these needs, if for no other reason than that
 any software built with multiple libraries will have  requirements similar to
 those of MPICH2 for compatibility.
\par
If your compilers are completely compatible, down to the runtime libraries,
 you may use the compilation scripts (\texttt{mpicc} etc.) by either
 specifying the compiler on the command line, e.g.
\begin{verbatim}
    mpicc -cc=icc -c foo.c
\end{verbatim}
or with the environment variables \texttt{MPICH\_CC} etc. (this example assume
 a c-shell syntax):
\begin{verbatim}
    setenv MPICH_CC icc
    mpicc -c foo.c
\end{verbatim}
If the compiler is compatible \emph{except} for the runtime libraries, then
 this same format works as long as a configuration file that describes the
 necessary runtime libraries is created and placed into the appropriate
 directory (the ``\texttt{sysconfdir}'' directory in configure terms).  See the
 installation manual for more details.
\par
In some cases, MPICH2 is able to build the Fortran interfaces in a way that
 supports multiple mappings of names from the Fortran source code to the
 object file.  This is done by using the ``multiple weak symbol'' support in
 some environments.  For example, when using \texttt{gcc} under Linux, this is
 the default.

%% Heading: Q: How do I configure to use the Absoft Fortran compilers?
%% Filename: absoft
%% End
A: You have several options.  One is to use the Fortran 90 compiler for both
F77 and F90.  Another (if you do not need Fortran 90) is to use 
\texttt{--disable-f90} when configuring.  The options with which we test
MPICH2 and the Absoft compilers are the following:
\begin{verbatim}
setenv FFLAGS "-f -B108"
setenv F90FLAGS "-YALL_NAMES=LCS -B108"
setenv F77 f77
setenf F90 f90
\end{verbatim}

%% Heading: Q: When I configure MPICH2, I get a message about FDZERO and the\
 configure aborts
%% Filename: fdzero
%% End
A: \texttt{FD\_ZERO} is part of the support for the select calls (see ``man
select'' or ``man 2 select'' on Linux and many other Unix systems) .  What this
means is that your system (probably a Mac) has a broken version of the
select call and related data types.  This is an OS bug; the only repair is to
update the OS to get past this bug.  This test was added specifically to
detect this error; if there was an easy way to work around it, we would have
included it (we don't just implement \texttt{FD\_ZERO} ourselves because we
don't know what else is broken in this implementation of select). 

If this configure works with gcc but not with xlc, then the problem is with
the include files that xlc is using; since this is an OS call (even if
emulated), all compilers should be using consistent if not identical include
files.  In this case, you may need to update xlc. 

%% Heading: Q: When I use the g95 Fortran compiler on a 64-bit platform, some\
  of the tests fail
%% Filename: g95
%% End
A: The g95 compiler incorrectly defines the default Fortran integer as a
64-bit integer while defining Fortran reals as 32-bit values (the Fortran
standard requires that INTEGER and REAL be the same size).  This was 
apparently done to allow a Fortran INTEGER to hold the value of a pointer, 
rather than requiring the programmer to select an INTEGER of a suitable KIND. 
To force the g95 compiler to correctly implement the Fortran standard, use the
\texttt{-i4} flag.  For example, set the environment variable
\texttt{F90FLAGS} before configuring MPICH2:
\begin{verbatim}
   setenv F90FLAGS "-i4"
\end{verbatim}
G95 users should note that there (at this writing) are two distributions of
g95 for 64-bit Linux platforms.  One uses 32-bit integers and reals (and
conforms to the Fortran standard) and one uses 32-bit integers and 64-bit
reals.  We recommend using the one that conforms to the standard (note that
the standard specifies the \emph{ratio} of sizes, not the absolute sizes, so a
Fortran 95 compiler that used 64 bits for \emph{both} INTEGER and REAL would
also conform to the Fortran standard.  However, such a compiler would need to
use 128 bits for DOUBLE PRECISION quantities).

%% Heading: Q: When I run make, it fails immediately with many errors \
beginning with ``sock.c:8:24: mpidu\_sock.h: No such file or directory \
In file included from sock.c:9: \
../../../../include/mpiimpl.h:91:21: mpidpre.h: No such file or directory \
In file included from sock.c:9: \
../../../../include/mpiimpl.h:1150: error: syntax error before "MPID\_VCRT" \
../../../../include/mpiimpl.h:1150: warning: no semicolon at end of struct or union''
%% Filename: cppflags
%% End
Check if you have set the envirnoment variable CPPFLAGS. If so, unset
it and use CXXFLAGS instead. Then rerun configure and make.

%% Heading: Q: When building the ssm or sshm channel, I get the \
error ``mpidu\_process\_locks.h:234:2: error: \#error *** No atomic memory \
operation specified to implement busy locks ***''
%% Filename: asmlocks
%% End
The ssm and sshm channels do not work on all platforms because they
use special interprocess locks (often assembly) that may not work
with some compilers or machine architectures. They work on Linux with
gcc, Intel, and Pathscale compilers on various Intel
architectures. They also work in Windows and Solaris environments.

%% Heading: Q: When using the Intel Fortran 90 compiler (version 9), the make \
fails with errors in compiling statement that reference \
\texttt{MPI\_ADDRESS\_KIND}.
%% Filename: ifortv9
%% End
Check the output of the configure step.  If configure claims that ifort is a
cross compiler, the likely problem is that programs compiled and linked with
ifort cannot be run because of a missing shared library.  Try to compile and 
run the following program (named conftest.f90):
\begin{verbatim}
      program conftest
      integer, dimension(10) :: n
      end
\end{verbatim}
If this program fails to run, then the problem is that your installation of
ifort either has an error or you need to add additional values to your
environment variables (such as \texttt{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}).  Check your 
installation documentation for the ifort compiler.  
See 
\url{http://softwareforums.intel.com/ISN/Community/en-US/search/SearchResults.aspx?q=libimf.so}
for an example of problems of this kind that users are having with version 9
of ifort.

If you do not need Fortran 90, you can configure with \texttt{--disable-f90}.

%% Heading: Q: The build fails when I use parallel make
%% Filename: parmake
%% End
Parallel make (often invoked with \texttt{make -j4}) will cause several 
job steps in the build process to update the same library file
(\texttt{libmpich.a}) concurrently.  Unfortunately, neither the
\texttt{ar} nor the \texttt{ranlib} programs correctly handle
this case, and the result is a corrupted library.  For now, the
solution is to not use a parallel make when building MPICH2.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
%% Section: Compiling MPI Programs
%% Heading: C++ and \texttt{SEEK\_SET}
%% Filename: cxxseek
%% End
Some users may get error messages such as
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
    SEEK_SET is #defined but must not be for the C++ binding of MPI
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
The problem is that both \texttt{stdio.h} and the MPI C++ interface use
\texttt{SEEK\_SET}, \texttt{SEEK\_CUR}, and \texttt{SEEK\_END}.  This is really a
bug in the MPI-2 standard.  You can try adding 
\begin{verbatim}
    #undef SEEK_SET
    #undef SEEK_END
    #undef SEEK_CUR
\end{verbatim}
before \texttt{mpi.h} is included, or add the definition
\begin{verbatim}
    -DMPICH_IGNORE_CXX_SEEK
\end{verbatim}
to the command line (this will cause the MPI versions of \texttt{SEEK\_SET}
etc. to be skipped).

%% Heading: C++ and Errors in Nullcomm::Clone
%% Filename: cxxvirtfunc
%% End
Some users, particularly with older C++ compilers, may see error messages
of the form
\begin{verbatim}
"error C2555: 'MPI::Nullcomm::Clone' : overriding virtual function differs from
'MPI::Comm::Clone' only by return type or calling convention".
\end{verbatim}
This is caused by the compiler not implementing part of the C++ standard.  
To work around this problem, add the definition
\begin{verbatim}
    -DHAVE_NO_VARIABLE_RETURN_TYPE_SUPPORT
\end{verbatim}
to the \texttt{CXXFLAGS} variable or add a
\begin{verbatim}
#define HAVE_NO_VARIABLE_RETURN_TYPE_SUPPORT 1
\end{verbatim}
before including \texttt{mpi.h}.

%% Section: Running MPI Programs
%% Heading: Q: How do I pass environment variables to the processes of my parallel program
%% Filename: envvars
%% End
A: The specific method depends on the process manager and version of 
\texttt{mpiexec} that you are using.  See the appropriate specific section.

%% Heading: Q:  How do I pass environment variables to the processes of \
my parallel program when using the mpd process manager?
%% Filename: envvarsmpd
%% End
A:  By default, all the environment variables in the shell where
\texttt{mpiexec} is run are passed to all processes of the application
program.  (The one exception is \texttt{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} when the
mpd's are being run as root.)  This default can be overridden in many
ways, and individual environment variables can be passed to specific
processes using arguments to \texttt{mpiexec}.  A synopsis of the
possible arguments can be listed by typing
\begin{verbatim}
    mpiexec -help
\end{verbatim}
and further details are available in the 
\href{http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich2/downloads/mpich2-doc-user.pdf}{Users Guide}.

%% Heading: Q:  What determines the hosts on which my MPI processes run?
%% Filename: whererun
%% End
A:  Where processes run, whether by default or by specifying them
yourself, depends on the process manager being used.

If you are using the \texttt{gforker} process manager, then all MPI
processes run on the same host where you are running \texttt{mpiexec}.

If you are using the \texttt{mpd} process manager, which is the default,
then many options are available.  If you are using \texttt{mpd}, then
before you run \texttt{mpiexec}, you will have started, or will have had
started for you, a ring of processes called \texttt{mpd}'s
(multi-purpose daemons), each running on its own host.  It is likely,
but not necessary, that each \texttt{mpd} will be running on a separate
host.  You can find out what this ring of hosts consists of by running
the program \texttt{mpdtrace}.  One of the \texttt{mpd}'s will be
running on the ``local'' machine, the one where you will run
\texttt{mpiexec}.  The default placement of MPI processes, if one runs
\begin{verbatim}
    mpiexec -n 10 a.out
\end{verbatim}
is to start the first MPI process (rank 0) on the local machine and then
to distribute the rest around the \texttt{mpd} ring one at a time.  If
there are more processes than \texttt{mpd}'s, then wraparound occurs.
If there are more \texttt{mpd}'s than MPI processes, then some
\texttt{mpd}'s will not run MPI processes.  Thus any number of processes
can be run on a ring of any size.  While one is doing development, it is
handy to run only one \texttt{mpd}, on the local machine.  Then all the
MPI processes will run locally as well.

The first modification to this default behavior is the \texttt{-1}
option to \texttt{mpiexec} (not a great argument name).  If \texttt{-1}
is specified, as in 
\begin{verbatim}
    mpiexec -1 -n 10 a.out
\end{verbatim}
then the first application process will be started by the first
\texttt{mpd} in the ring \emph{after} the local host.  (If there is only
one \texttt{mpd} in the ring, then this will be on the local host.)
This option is for use when a cluster of compute nodes has a ``head
node'' where commands like \texttt{mpiexec} are run but not application
processes. 

If an \texttt{mpd} is started with the \texttt{--ncpus} option, then
when it is its turn to start a process, it will start several
application processes rather than just one before handing off the task
of starting more processes to the next \texttt{mpd} in the ring.  For
example, if the \texttt{mpd} is started with
\begin{verbatim}
    mpd --ncpus=4
\end{verbatim}
then it will start as many as four application processes, with
consecutive ranks, when it is its turn to start processes.  This option
is for use in clusters of SMP's, when the user would like consecutive
ranks to appear on the same machine.  (In the default case, the same
number of processes might well run on the machine, but their ranks would
be different.)

(A feature of the \texttt{--ncpus=[n]} argument is that it has the above effect only
until all of the mpd's have started n processes at a time once;
afterwards each mpd starts one process at a time.  This is in order to 
balance the number of processes per machine to the extent possible.)

Other ways to control the placement of processes are by direct use of
arguments to \texttt{mpiexec}.  See the 
\href{http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich2/downloads/mpich2-doc-user.pdf}{Users Guide}.

%% Heading: Q: On Windows, I get an error when I attempt to call \texttt{MPI\_Comm\_spawn}.
%% Filename: windows-spawn
%% End
A: On Windows, you need to start the program with \texttt{mpiexec} for
any of the MPI-2 dynamic process functions to work.

%% Heading: Q: My output does not appear until the program exits
%% Filename: stdoutflush
%% End
A: Output to \texttt{stdout} and \texttt{stderr} may not be written
from your process immediately after a \texttt{printf} or \texttt{fprintf} (or
\texttt{PRINT} in Fortran) because, under Unix, such output is
\emph{buffered} unless the program believes that the output is to a
terminal.  When the program is run by \texttt{mpiexec}, the C standard I/O
library (and normally the Fortran runtime library) will buffer the
output.  For C programmers, you can either use a call \texttt{fflush(stdout)}
to force the output to be written or you can set no buffering by
calling
\begin{verbatim}
   #include <stdio.h>
   
   setvbuf( stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0 );
\end{verbatim}
on each file descriptor (\texttt{stdout} in this example) which you
want to send the output immedately to your terminal or file.

There is no standard way to either change the buffering mode or to
flush the output in Fortran.  However, many Fortrans include an
extension to provide this function.  For example, in \texttt{g77}, 
\begin{verbatim}
    call flush()
\end{verbatim}
can be used.  The \texttt{xlf} compiler supports 
\begin{verbatim}
    call flush_(6)
\end{verbatim}
where the argument is the Fortran logical unit number (here
\texttt{6}, which is often the unit number associated with \texttt{PRINT}).
With the G95 Fortran 95 compiler, set the environment variable 
\texttt{G95\_UNBUFFERED\_6} to cause output to unit 6 to be unbuffered.

%% Heading: Q: Fortran programs using stdio fail when using g95
%% Filename: g95-stdio
%% End
A: By default, g95 does not flush output to stdout.  This also appears
to cause problems for standard input.  If you are using the Fortran logical
units 5 and 6 (or the \texttt{*} unit) for standard input and output, set the 
environment variable \texttt{G95\_UNBUFFERED\_6} to \texttt{yes}.

%% Heading: Q: How do I run MPI programs in the background when using the default MPD process manager? 
%% Filename: background
%% End
A: To run MPI programs in the background when using MPD, you need to
redirect stdin from \texttt{/dev/null}. For example, 
\begin{verbatim}
    mpiexec -n 4 a.out < /dev/null & 
\end{verbatim}
