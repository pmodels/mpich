* agent (bottom up)

* pt2pt

  - wildcard receives (and matching in general)

* make progress

* inter-method interface

the next thing to do:
- define CARs for the send and receive case
- define an interface to the CA to satisfy these CARs
- define an interface to the method(s) which can service these CARs or
  whatever the agent passes down
- work through a scenario using this whole layered design

- rinse and repeat for a collective scenario
