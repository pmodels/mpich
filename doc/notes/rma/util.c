	 *
	 * NOTE: This code assumes that the (dest_count, dest_datatype)
	 * represents enough space to accomodate (src_count, src_datatype) and

	 * Q: Does a datatype be denoted as "contiguous" imply that the extent
	 * and the true extent (size) are the same?  In other words, can a
	 * contiguous datatype have padding?  If it can, then we can't use a
	 * straight memory copy because we will be copying unwanted bytes.
	 *
	 * For the simple case where neither the src nor the dest datatypes
	 * contain any padding a simple memory copy with work.  If padding
	 * exists in either datatype, we need a loop and extra logic to ensure
	 * that we don't touch the padded areas. This is true even if they are
	 * the two datatypes are the same.  We simply don't know if the padding
	 * represents a skip over unused memory resulting from alignment
	 * problems, or if it is being used to skip over locations containing
	 * data we don't need for this operation.  If the latter is true, then
	 * a straight memory copy would wipe out live data.
